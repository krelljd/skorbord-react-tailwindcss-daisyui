/**
 * TeamManager component
 *
 * This component manages teams and their players for a game. It is designed to be mobile-first, touch-friendly,
 * and accessible, using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for styling. All state and logic are passed via props for reusability.
 *
 * Why: Teams are a core part of the Skorbord app, supporting both individual and team-based games. This component
 * allows users to create, edit, and manage teams and their players before a game begins, with real-time updates.
 *
 * Props:
 *   teams: Array<{ id: number, name: string, color?: string, players: Array<{ id: number, name: string }> }>
 *     - The current list of teams, each with a unique id, name, optional color, and list of players.
 *   availablePlayers: Array<{ id: number, name: string }>
 *     - Players not currently assigned to any team, available to be added.
 *   onAddTeam: function()
 *     - Called when the user requests to add a new team.
 *   onRemoveTeam: function(teamId)
 *     - Called when the user requests to remove a team.
 *   onAddPlayerToTeam: function(teamId, playerId)
 *     - Called when the user adds a player to a team.
 *   onRemovePlayerFromTeam: function(teamId, playerId)
 *     - Called when the user removes a player from a team.
 *   onEditTeamName: function(teamId, newName)
 *     - Called when the user edits a team's name.
 *   onEditPlayerName: function(playerId, newName)
 *     - Called when the user edits a player's name.
 *   disabled?: boolean
 *     - If true, disables all controls (e.g., when game is in progress).
 *
 * All UI controls are optimized for touch and accessibility. Font sizes use vw units for mobile scaling.
 *
 * This component is stateless and can be reused in any context where team management is needed.
